## General Information
- I built a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
- It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- This model can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma. This model has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Technologies Used
- Jupyter NoteBook
- Googlr Colab
- Tensor Flow

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->
## Conclusions
- Created a CNN model that uses the method of dropping, sequencing and dense layers.
- Achieved validation accuracy of 73%.

## Acknowledgements
- I thank Upgrad for providing me the dataset and the instructions to successfully build this model.
